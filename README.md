#### The Iris program requires the data from the following two .csv files:

* http://download.tensorflow.org/data/iris_training.csv, which contains the training set.
* http://download.tensorflow.org/data/iris_test.csv, which contains the the test set.

## Installation

We need TensorFlow and pandas. Install it using the pip command

```bash
$ mkvirtualenv iris-classifier
$ workon iris-classifier
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the program

```python
python iris_classifier.property
```
